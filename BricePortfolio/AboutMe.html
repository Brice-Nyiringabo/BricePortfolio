    <h1><b>Web Application Design and Development</b></h1>
    
    <p>My Approach to Development and What Fuels Me Most: </p>

    <p>
        <p><b>Make the world a better place</b></p>
        As a developer, I want to make an impact. My goal is always to make something that saves us time and can increase our productivity.

        <b>coding is my passion</b> I have explored many technologies, but my interest in software development stands out. I am an aspiring full-stack developer. My latest project was a full-stack e-commerce web application. I primarily use ASP.NET but am currently learning a new framework called NopCommerce. I have worked with various databases, including SQL and MySQL...

        <p><b>I admire Learning</b></p>
        At times, I’m motivated to win. Other times, I’m motivated by failure. But through my analysis, I’ve found that I’m most successful when I put fear and anxiety aside and work patiently toward a goal I’m passionate about. Every Human being needs composure, resilience and patience, that’s very key to me.To be honest still focussed on winning or losing but l inderstand simply dedication to learning and working hard, regardless of the scale of success is more important to my perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        <p><b>Competition</b></p>
        You have to compete, especially in a capitalist system, where everything is a race, competition pushes me beyond my expectations. It drives me to improve and innovate continuously.
    </p>

    <p>
        <p><b>Money</b></p>    
        My purpose as a man is beyond making money. Relationships with friends, Family and society at large, thing like Love is true value. But on the other hand, The monitary system was created by us. It's not the only way but as for now it's the chosen way. I believe money simplifies life to an extent but no one should make money his end goal . we are all here for a greater purpose.   
        Financial success matters. Every Human being should work for self and community. Taxes should be invested and useded to implement real ideas that can make a difference.
